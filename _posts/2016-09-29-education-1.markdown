Last year I finished my studies Applied Informatics, Mobile Applications at University College Ghent.
During my studies I was really interested in web and native mobile development but I also created a passion for project management. That is one of the reasons I decided to go for a postgraduate IT management.
I believe this study will be a great preparation for a management job in IT.
