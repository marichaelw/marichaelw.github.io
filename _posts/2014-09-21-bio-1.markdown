As I already mentioned my name is Wiebe Marichael. I'll turn 21 the 6th of april.
I grew up and still live together with my 2 younger brothers and my mother in Ruiselede.
I'm a student Applied Informatics at HoGent University. At this moment I'm in my last year Mobile Applications.
When I'm not working for school, I like to be with my family and friends.
I also enjoy spending time in the gym and I'm also into 'the healthy lifestyle'.
Apart from that I like to surf when I have the chance to.
