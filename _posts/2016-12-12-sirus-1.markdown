To gain experience while studying IT management, I decided to look for a part-time job. <a href="http://www.sirus.be">Sirus</a> is giving me this opportunity which I'm very thankful for!
As part of a high end consulting company, our mission is to bring specialized knowledge to our customer to make them successful. We have solid experience in .NET & Sharepoint, but also embrace innovative thinking and Internet of Things. 
As junior IT consult I'm able to work on interesting projects that allow me to further develop my skills and gain experience.
