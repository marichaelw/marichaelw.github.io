During my internship at <a href="http://www.openknowledge.be">Open Knowledge Belgium</a> my colleague and I were given the challenge to design and implement an application. The app is meant to motivate the students in Ghent to move more by bike. It is a tracker app that collects data for the cyclist and the city.
