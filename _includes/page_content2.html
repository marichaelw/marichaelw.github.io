                    <div class="lead">My name is Wiebe Marichael and I am a 21 year old student from Belgium. I recently finished my studies Applied Informatics at University College Ghent. I completed my last year which was focused around Mobile Applications.<br/>
                      Next year I want to develop my skills more towards IT and project management.<br />
                    I grew up and still live together with my 2 younger brothers and my mother in Ruiselede. As a young kid all I was doing was going outside and play sports. During the last 5 years I grew a passion for web and native development.<br/>
                    Next to coding I also have a passion for fitness and surfing. I love to travel and to hang out with my friends.

                    <div class="lead">During my internship at <a href="http://www.openknowledge.be">Open Knowledge Belgium</a> my colleague and I were given the challenge to design and implement an application. The app is meant to motivate the students in Ghent to move more by bike. It is a tracker app that collects data for the cyclist and the city. You can find more information about the app on our <a href="https://goegefietst.gent">website</a>. The source code is open source and you can find it <a href="https://github.com/goegefietst">here</a>.</div>
